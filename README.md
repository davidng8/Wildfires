# Wildfires
## Project Proposal
Wildfire causes harm to buildings around them from the spread, and with wildfire data, we can find where wildfires most occur and during which time in correlation to the health of the forests around where the wildfire starts, Using a geo-narrative to map our data would be the best way to represent our idea. 
## Target Audience
Our target audience is people interested in environmental health, homeowners, construction planning, and environmental hazards.
