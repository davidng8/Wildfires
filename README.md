# Wildfires
## Project Proposal
Wildfire causes harm to buildings around them from the spread, and with wildfire data, we can find where wildfires most occur and during which time in correlation to the health of the forests around where the wildfire starts, Using a geo-narrative to map our data would be the best way to represent our idea. We will use a geo-narrative with thematic layers to show the change of wildfires over time.
## Target Audience
Our target audience is people interested in environmental health, homeowners, construction planning, and environmental hazards.
## Functions
We are going to be using a geo-narrative to display wildfire data and the changes of these fires over periods of time, to reveal common locations of fires and how much or less the fire has spread throughout years. We will do this by using interactive elements on maps and multiple maps on different time periods with the same variable of data.
