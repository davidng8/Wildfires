# Wildfires
## Project Proposal
Wildfire causes harm to buildings around them from the spread, and with wildfire data, we can find where wildfires most occur and during which time in correlation to the health of the forests around where the wildfire starts, Using a geo-narrative to map our data would be the best way to represent our idea. We will use a geo-narrative with thematic layers to show the change of wildfires over time.
## Target Audience
Our target audience is people interested in environmental health, homeowners, construction planning, and environmental hazards.
## Functions
We are going to be using a geo-narrative to display wildfire data and the changes of these fires over periods of time, to reveal common locations of fires and how much or less the fire has spread throughout years. We will do this by using interactive elements on maps and multiple maps on different time periods with the same variable of data.
## Libraries
## Map Projection 
  - Mercator 
## Base Map
  - Monochrome base map of Washington State 
## Description of Thematic Layers 
1. Two maps of Washington state; one with a side bar of forest health between the years 2010-2019; a second map with a side bar of forest fires 
between the years 2010-2019 with a hover interactive element that enables the user to hover over different areas of Washington and see when/where 
different forest fires have occurred.

description of the thematic layers you will make.
i. the used visual strategies: choropleth, proportional symbols, etc.
ii. the supporting data sets for each thematic map layer.
iii. vector or raster layer. If it is a vector, which data attribute to use? If raster, which zoom level and presumed boundingbox to use?

draft the storyline
for each scene/action, describe the following items in detail:
i. the map you plan to draw
ii. the associated script
iii. the multimedia (e.g., image, video, chart, external links, etc)
how would you transit from one scene/action to another one? like, fly from one location to another, zoom in or zoom out?
